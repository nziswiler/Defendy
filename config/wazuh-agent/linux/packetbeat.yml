#################### Packetbeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is an example configuration file highlighting only the most common
# options. The packetbeat.reference.yml file from the same directory contains all the
# supported options with more comments. You can use it as a reference.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/index.html

# =============================== Network device ===============================

# Select the network interface to sniff the data. On Linux, you can use the
# "any" keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
packetbeat.interfaces.device: any

# The network CIDR blocks that are considered "internal" networks for
# the purpose of network perimeter boundary classification. The valid
# values for internal_networks are the same as those that can be used
# with processor network conditions.
#
# For a list of available values see:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/defining-processors.html#condition-network
packetbeat.interfaces.internal_networks:
  - private

# =================================== Flows ====================================

# Set `enabled: false` or comment out all options to disable flows reporting.
packetbeat.flows:
  # Set network flow timeout. Flow is killed if no packet is received before being
  # timed out.
  timeout: 30s

  # Configure reporting period. If set to -1, only killed flows will be reported
  period: 10s
